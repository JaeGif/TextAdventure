# TextAdventure
# This is a demo game made solely to practice using python3 and show an intermediate understanding of python concepts and pythonic code.
#
# This game is the result of me teaching myself python3 and attempting to utilize it tot the best of my ability at this time. Throughout the course
# of the projects, the commits can even show my learning in nearly live time. At the beginning of the project, I didn't know what a class was
# and instead used nested dictionaries. I slowly developed related functions in separate .py files and integrated them into the main module as their
# functionalities were becoming more significantly developed and intertwined. 
#
# Currently there are no plans to make a full game, but the demo will eventually be updated with a python wrapper and a simple GUI.
